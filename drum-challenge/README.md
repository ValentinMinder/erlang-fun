## Introduction
In this second exercise of lab 1, we will try to solve the drum challenge, originally written for Go developers. The challenge requires a good handling of binary files, which makes Erlang an interesting alternative language to solve the challenge.

## API methods

### Public methods

#### decode_file/1
Decode a file.
* **Input**: file name of .splice file
* **Output**: {ok, VersionName, Tempo, Tracks}
              with Tracks as {TrackNo, Instrument, MeasureStruct}
              with MeasureStruct as an array of array of bytes, grouped 4 by 4

#### render_file/1
Decode and renders a file.
* **Input**: file name of .splice file
* **Output**: {ok, Render} where Render is a List (string) representing the file.

### Internal / Parsing methods

#### parse_header/1
Parse a binary file and extract headers, leaving the content as binary.
Returns error parse_header if magic is incorrect or not enough data provided.
Any subsequent data is unused.
* **Input**: a binary of .slice file
* **Ouput**: a tuple {ok, VersionName, Tempo, TracksBinary}

#### parse_tracks/1  
Recursively parse tracks binary and extract their headers and their content, the measure.
* **Input**: a binary of tracks
* **Output**: an array of tracks, each containing {TrackNo, Instrument, MeasureStruct}
              MeasureStruct as defined in parse_measure(Bin).
       
#### parse_measure/1            
Parse a binary Measure and returns its structure as an array of array
Byte can only have values 0 or 1, otherwise an error is returned.
* **Input**: binary representation of a Measure
             Example: <<0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1>>
* **Output**: an array of array of bytes, grouped 4 by 4
             Example: [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1]]

#### parse_measure_no_validation/1
Parse without validation of bytes

#### validate_measure/1
Validation of bytes of the Measure.
If failing the whole group is returned.
  
#### validate_group_within_measure/1
Validation of group with measure : each byte is either 0 or 1.

### Internal / rendering methods

#### render/3
Renders the header of the structure and calls the rendering of tracks
* **Input**: a Tuple of Version, Tempo, and array of Tracks
             Example: "foo bar 42", 120.0, [Tracks]
* **Output**: a List, rendering of headers (each on its line), rendering of all tracks
* **Example**: "Saved with HW Version: foo bar 42\nTempo: 120\nTracksRendering"

#### float_format/2
Takes a Float and returns a List, formatted as follow:
- if the Float with Precision decimals evaluates to an Int, the Int representation (eg: Float 12.0 -> "12")
- otherwise, the Float representation with Precision digits (eg: Float 12.432, Precision 1 -> "12.4")
 
#### render_tracks/2
Recursively pretty render of tracks, for each calls the rendering of its Measure
* **Input**: An array of Tracks, A integer
             Example: [{0, "kick", Measure}]
* **Ouput**: a List (string) rendering all Tracks, each Track rendered on its own line.
             Example: "(0) kick\tMeasureRender\n"

#### render_measure/1
Pretty render of a measure
* **Input**: an array of arrays of byte, called a Measure
             Example: [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]
* **Output**: a List (string), where global array elements separated by |, 0 is -, 1 is x
             Example: |--x-|--x-|x-x-|--x-|
             
#### render_group/1
Pretty render of a group within a measure
* **Input**: an array of byte, called a Group
             Example: [1, 0, 1, 0]
* **Output**: a List (string), where 0 is -, 1 is x
             Example: x-x-

#### binary_to_string/1
Takes a Bin and returns the list represented, without trailing zeroes.

#### remove_trailing_zeroes/1
Takes a list, return the list limited up to the first 0 found, not included.
